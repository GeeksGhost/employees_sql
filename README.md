# Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Research

## Background

Welcome to your first major task as a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard! In this project, you will conduct research on employees who worked at the company during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files, which you will use to recreate the database and perform your analysis.

## Objectives

1. **Data Modeling: understanding how how the tables work together using a Entity Relationship Diagram
2. **Data Engineering: creating tables that correspond to included .csv files and assigning appropriate primary and foreign keys. 
3. **Data Analysis**: querying the data to understand what information can be gathered from the tables. 


## Project Structure
The code uses information from the following .csv files and utilitzes tools from http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/
  - `employees.csv`
  - `departments.csv`
  - `titles.csv`
  - `salaries.csv`
  - `dept_emp.csv`
  - `dept_manager.csv`
